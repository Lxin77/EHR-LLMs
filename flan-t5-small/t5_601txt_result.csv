She had a recent admission for jaw/chest pain where found to have only a 40% proximal LAD lesion but was noted to be in rapid afib and was discharged on diltiazem for rate control. She was discharged with   of hearts monitor.  She was subsuquently seen by Dr.  in cardiology clinic where she was again found to be in rapid a-fib, with a rate near 150; admission for cardioversion was discussed at length, but the patient refused, so she was started on metoprolol 50mg , aspirin, and warfarin. . The pt continued to have SOB and palpitations so she sought further care in . The pt denies any chest pain. In the ED, the pt briefly required non-invasive ventilatory support for the SOB.

The pt was transferred to the CCU for further monitoring and management. The plan at the CCU was to place a temporary pacer wire so that rate control therapy could be safely started once a back-up rhythm could be guaranteed by the temporary pacer. Venous cannulation was unable to be acheived at the bedside.
