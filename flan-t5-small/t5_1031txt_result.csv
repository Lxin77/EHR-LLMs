CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient was taken to Cardiac Catheterization where she was found to have two vessel disease.  The proximal LAD was found to have a 90% lesion with a septal branch with a 95% stenosis and a diagonal branch with 99% stenosis.  The patient had twin LAD stents to the LAD diagonal and LAD septal branches with Taxus stents.  This restored flow appropriately.  The patient also had proximal RCA lesion of 80% and a mid RCA lesion of 80-90% which were not intervened upon.  The patient was given an aspirin and Plavix and in addition started on a beta ,  ACE inhibitor, and these were titrated up as her blood pressure tolerated.  Given the fact that the patient had issues with muscle cramping with Atorvastatin in the past, she was started on Pravastatin which should give less of these side effects.

She was found to have an ejection fraction of|0-35% as well as an akinetic apex and apical mid and septal akinesis.
