6,What did serial chest x-ray show?,"[""This is a -year-old female with multiple medical problems including atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, who lives in a nursing home at , who was found to be pale and weak with difficulty breathing.  The patient's oxygen saturation on two liters was 61% and increased from 86% to 88% on eight liters nasal cannula.  Vital signs at that time revealed the following:  The patient was afebrile at 98.6, blood pressure|0/60, heart rate 96 to 120 and irregular.  She was subsequently transferred to  for further evaluation.  She was noted to have significant respiratory distress breathing at 30.  She was started on BiPAP.

HEART:  Heart revealed prominent external jugular distention with no LAD, mild regurgitation.  CHEST:  Diffuse crackles bilaterally.  CARDIAC:  Irregularly irregular tachyatrial fibrillation, 3/6 systolic murmur at base. ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.

Urine negative for nitrites.  BUN was 42, and creatinine 1.7. Serial chest x-ray showed moderate cardiomegaly with some bilateral opacifications in the left upper and right upper lobes with multifocal pneumonia.  EKG showed atrial fibrillation at 120, with poor R-wave progression with left axis deviation, pseudochanges in T waves in V1 through V3, compared to 6/.|The patient was subsequently placed on BiPAP overnight, while in the MICU.  The oxygenation status improved significantly overnight.  She was subsequently able to tolerate saturation well.  On 5 liters nasal cannula saturating 95%.  She was subsequently called out of the unit and she was continued on Albuterol and Atrovent inhalers. Chest CT and supplemental oxygen as well as Mucomyst.  She was started on Levofloxacin for presumed pneumonia and sputum cultures were sent.  Sputum culture subsequently came back with MRSA pneumonia as well as H. influenza pneumonia.  The patient was subsequently started on Vancomycin for treatment. The patient's oxygenation status defervesced on hospital day #4 at which point she was found to be in respiratory distress once again, breathing at 44 and saturating 90% on 1% nonrebreather.  The patient was subsequently transferred to the unit once again.  However, overnight, she was subsequently found to be grossly fluid overloaded, diuresed aggressively.
